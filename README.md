# Record safe
------------------------

Record safe it's an application for the classic sound of vinyls collectors, with Record safe you can easily keep track of vinyls collection.

## Planning
-----------------------------
As my second project at GA I had to create a full stack application, using Ruby on rails for the back end.

In this project I used the following technologies:

* jQuery
* JavaScript
* Html
* CSS/SASS
* Bootstrap
* Ajax
* Handlebars
* Ruby on Rails

Like any project day one was all about planning and setting everything up, after reviewing the requirements I came up with the following user stories for v1:

1. As a user, I want to create a user account.
2. As a user, I want log in into my account.
3. As a user, I want to change my password.
4. As a user, I want to log out of my account.
5. As a user, I want to create new records.
6. As a user, I want to see my record collection.
7. As a user, I want to update my records info.
8. As a user, I want to delete any record from my collection.
9. As a user, I want my collection to be private.

#### Wireframes and ERD
------------------------------

These are my initial wireframes I used this to give an idea in how the final product should look.

### Development process
--------

This app is a work in progress I'll keep adding features in the short term, V1
was about setting the basics, user interaction and basic API functionality.

### Future updates/iteractions
-------

- Add Artists collection, the user will be able to search all the artist in the collection.
- Add active links to straming services with record or artist related content.
- Add search bar to look for specific artist or records in the collection.
- Add a database with Artists so User can select the artist instead of typing this will avoid duplicates.
